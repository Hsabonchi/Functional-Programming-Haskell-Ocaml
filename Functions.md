In Haskell, a function is a mapping that takes one or more arguments and produces a single result, and is defined using an equation that gives a name for the function, a name for each of its arguments, and a body that specifies how the result can be calculated in terms of the arguments.
For example, 
a function double that takes a number x as its argument, and produces the result x + x, can be defined by the following equation:
`double x = x + x`
