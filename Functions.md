In Haskell, a function is a mapping that takes one or more arguments and produces a single result, and is defined using an equation that gives a name for the function, a name for each of its arguments, and a body that specifies how the result can be calculated in terms of the arguments.
For example, 
a function double that takes a number x as its argument, and produces the result x + x, can be defined by the following equation:
 <br>
 ### `double x = x + x`
<ol>
  <li> A function double that takes a number x as its argument</li>
  <li> Produces the result x + x </li>
 <li> When a function is applied to actual arguments, the result is obtained by substituting these arguments into the body of the function in place of the argument names. </li>
</li>
</ol>


#####  “every function has a type that specifies the nature of its arguments and results, which is automatically inferred from the definition of the function”
