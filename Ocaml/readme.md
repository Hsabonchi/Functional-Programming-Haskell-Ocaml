Important Notes about Programming:
#### There are two main differences between dynamic typing and static typing
- First, dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages (like Groovy) can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). If a script written in a statically-typed language (such as Java) contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.
- Second, statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.
- Dynamically-typed languages are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts

 Side notes
  - float_of_int is a function which takes an int and returns a float.
  - <strong> --> </strong> refers to  evaluation.
  - <strong> string_of_int </strong> converts an integer to a string value.
  - Underscore (_) is a wildcard that will match anything, useful as a default or when you just donâ€™t care.
  - print_int, print_float,print_char,print_endline.
