    Some distinguishing features of Functional Programming?:
    
    1. Recursion instead of iteration.
    2. Pattern matching on values.
    3. Expressions instead of statements.
    4. Functions as first-class citizens.
    
    ▶ You can write “functional code” in almost any language.
    
  
     What is a statically typed?
     A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time.
     
     ▶ Every expression and function has a type.
     ▶ The compiler prevents wrong combinations.
     ▶ OCaml eliminates many of the type-related runtime problems associated with dynamically typed languages.
     ▶OCaml t's used in environments where <a href="https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html"> a single mistake can cost millions and speed matters</a>
